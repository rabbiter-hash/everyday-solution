# Integer Hypotenuse

Given two positive integers representing the lengths for the two legs (the two short sides) of a right triangle, determine whether the hypotenuse is an integer.

The length of the hypotenuse is calculated by adding the squares of the two leg lengths together and then taking the square root of that total (a2 + b2 = c2).



翻译成白话文就是：

给出两个正整数，代表 **直角三角形的两条直角边（短边）**，判断 **斜边长度是不是整数**。
